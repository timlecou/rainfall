After disassembling the binary I see interesting things:

-A call to atoi() and a call to strcmp() on argv[1]
-A call to fread() on the password
-A call to exec() and launch a shell

I need to make the line execute, it is after the condition:
if (strcmp(buffer, argv[1]) == 0)

so if I want to make this condition true I have to match the buffer content with argv[1] I have to find an input that does that.

On the code before the condition we can see:

buffer[input] = 0;

So a \0 will be inserted at the index of argv[1].

I can input an empty string "" so the value returned by atoi will be 0 and the buffer variable will have a \0 on the first cvharacter and be equal to "" too.

Let's try:

bonus3@RainFall:~$ ./bonus3 ""
$ whoami
end
$ cat /home/user/end/.pass
